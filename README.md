## 🧬 Featured Research Projects

### Gut-Brain Axis Research

**[Microbiome Diversity & ASD Anxiety Analysis](https://github.com/farid-bioinfo/multiple-regression-asd-anxiety)** ✅
- Multiple regression analysis examining relationships between gut microbiome diversity, diet quality, sleep, and anxiety in ASD
- Statistical modelling of multifactorial influences on neurodevelopmental outcomes
- **Key Finding:** 73% variance explained, sleep identified as strongest predictor

**[Gut-Brain Interaction Effects Study](https://github.com/farid-bioinfo/gut-brain-interaction-effects)** ✅
- Advanced statistical modelling exploring synergistic effects between gut microbiome composition and dietary interventions
- Application of interaction terms to personalised intervention design
- **Key Finding:** Diversity effect depends on diet quality (p<0.001), demonstrating context-dependent mechanisms

**[16S rRNA Analysis Pipeline]** 🔬 *In Development*
- Microbiome profiling pipeline for gut-brain axis studies
